# Invsee Mod Fabric
This mod lets you read all the packet data sent to a Minecraft client about a rendered entity when hitting the END key while targeting them with your cursor. This pulls up a sudo 9x1 chest gui to let you see their armor and held items including all of their nbt similar to how [Wurst Hacked Client](https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7) does this but in a standalone mod written from scratch. It also sends all the data about the entity that your client has received to the latest.log
# How is this useful?
You can see data you wouldn't normally be able to such as:
- The contents of a shulker
- the words in a book
- the enchantments on items
- the durability of an item
- how many items the player is holding
- the names of the items
- and more
